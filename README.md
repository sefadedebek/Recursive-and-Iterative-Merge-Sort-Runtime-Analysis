# Recursive and Iterative Merge Sort Runtime Analysis
Implementation of Algorithm Recursive Merge Sort and Iterative Merge Sort and Insertion Sort Runtime Analysis Comparison


1) A 20-element array is generated randomly between 0 and 100.
  a) The array is sorted according to the (iterative)-merge sort algorithm.
  b) Sort the array according to the recursive-merge sort algorithm.

Each step of the sorting algorithm is printed on the screen and the running times are calculated.
The runtimes for a and b are compared.

2) The resulting array is sorted with insertion sort and the runtime is calculated. This time is compared with the result obtained with merge sort.
